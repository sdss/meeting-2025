    text: |
    The Early Career Travel Fund (ECTF) is now open to all early career researchers in SDSS-V. This update follows a 2024 policy change led by Keith Hawkins and the Collaboration Council and approved by the AC/EC. We hope it helps early career researchers, particularly those attending the SDSS-V Collaboration Meeting in June.

### Welcome to the SDSS-V Collaboration Meeting!  

The 2025 SDSS-V Collaboration Meeting will be held in Heidelberg, Germany, hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA). This marks the first time in 10 years that the meeting returns to Europe, offering a unique opportunity to gather in one of Europeâ€™s most historic and picturesque cities.

The SDSS-V project continues its ambitious mission, encompassing three key projects â€” the Milky Way Mapper, the Local Volume Mapper, and the Black Hole Mapper. Together, these projects are on track to observe nearly 6 million stars in the Milky Way and satellite galaxies, 400,000 black holes and galaxy clusters, and 3,000 square degrees of the ionized interstellar medium from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) and the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO).

With the next public data release scheduled for Summer 2025, this yearâ€™s meeting will be especially timely. The focus will be on the latest SDSS-V science results, project status updates, and tutorials. The meeting will feature a mix of plenary sessions, splinter discussions, and workshops designed to facilitate collaboration and highlight ongoing and future work.

Join us in Heidelberg for an exciting week of discovery, discussion, and collaboration in the vibrant SDSS-V community!
